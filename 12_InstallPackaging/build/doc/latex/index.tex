The following tests are available\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{0}} -\/ Benchmark. \item {\bfseries{1}} -\/ Buffer volume test. \item {\bfseries{2}} -\/ Buffer size test. \item {\bfseries{3}} -\/ Test for the buffer size after making an element. \item {\bfseries{4}} -\/ Test for the correct value of this element. \item {\bfseries{5}} -\/ Buffer cleaning test. \item {\bfseries{6}} -\/ Test whether the buffer is not released. \item {\bfseries{7}} -\/ Test for freeing up memory for the buffer. \item {\bfseries{8}} -\/ Test for the size of the freed buffer. \item {\bfseries{9}} -\/ Test for the value of the pointer of the freed buffer. \item {\bfseries{10}} -\/ Size test for 10,000 items. \item {\bfseries{11}} -\/ Test for the correct element search. \item {\bfseries{12}} -\/ Buffer size increase test. \item {\bfseries{13}} -\/ Memory size test after buffer grow. \item {\bfseries{14}} -\/ Buffer Truncation test. \item {\bfseries{15}} -\/ Tests for adding and removing using push buffer. \item {\bfseries{16}} -\/ Tests for adding and removing using pop buffer. \item {\bfseries{17-\/21}} -\/ Tests for adding and removing using push and pop buffers. \end{DoxyItemize}
